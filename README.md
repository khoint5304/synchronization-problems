## [ABA Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem)

The ABA problem is a subtle challenge that can arise in multithreaded programming when dealing with shared memory. It occurs during synchronization, specifically when relying solely on a variable's current value to determine if data has been modified. 

The ABA problem occurs when multiple threads (or processes) accessing shared data interleave. Below is a sequence of events that illustrates the ABA problem:

1. Process $P_1$ reads value A from some shared memory location.

2. $P_1$ is preempted, allowing process $P_2$ to run.

3. $P_2$ writes value B to the shared memory location.

4. $P_2$ writes value A to the shared memory location.

5. $P_2$ is preempted, allowing process $P_1$ to run.

6. $P_1$ reads value A from the shared memory location.

7. $P_1$ determines that the shared memory value has not changed and continues.

### Example

```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <windows.h>

class __StackNode
{
public:
    const int value;
    bool valid = true;  // for demonstration purpose
    __StackNode *next;

    __StackNode(int value, __StackNode *next) : value(value), next(next) {}
    __StackNode(int value) : __StackNode(value, nullptr) {}
};

class Stack
{
private:
    std::atomic<__StackNode *> _head_ptr = nullptr;

public:
    /** Pop the head object and return its value */
    int pop(bool sleep)
    {
        while (true)
        {
            __StackNode *head_ptr = _head_ptr;
            if (head_ptr == nullptr)
            {
                throw std::out_of_range("Empty stack");
            }

            // For simplicity, suppose that we can ensure that this dereference is safe
            // (i.e., that no other thread has popped the stack in the meantime).
            __StackNode *next_ptr = head_ptr->next;

            if (sleep)
            {
                Sleep(200); // interleave
            }

            // If the head node is still head_ptr, then assume no one has changed the stack.
            // (That statement is not always true because of the ABA problem)
            // Atomically replace head node with next.
            if (_head_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(head_ptr, next_ptr))
            {
                int result = head_ptr->value;
                head_ptr->valid = false; // mark this memory as released
                delete head_ptr;
                return result;
            }
            // The stack has changed, start over.
        }
    }

    /** Push a value to the stack */
    void push(int value)
    {
        __StackNode *value_ptr = new __StackNode(value);
        while (true)
        {
            __StackNode *next_ptr = _head_ptr;
            value_ptr->next = next_ptr;
            // If the head node is still next, then assume no one has changed the stack.
            // (That statement is not always true because of the ABA problem)
            // Atomically replace head with value.
            if (_head_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(next_ptr, value_ptr))
            {
                return;
            }
            // The stack has changed, start over.
        }
    }

    void print()
    {
        __StackNode *current = _head_ptr;
        while (current != nullptr)
        {
            std::cout << current->value << " ";
            current = current->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    void assert_valid()
    {
        __StackNode *current = _head_ptr;
        while (current != nullptr)
        {
            if (!current->valid)
            {
                throw std::runtime_error("Invalid stack node");
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
    }
};

DWORD WINAPI thread_proc(void *_stack)
{
    Stack *stack = (Stack *)_stack;
    stack->pop(false);
    stack->pop(false);
    stack->push(40);

    return 0;
}

int main()
{
    Stack stack;
    stack.push(10);
    stack.push(20);
    stack.push(30);
    stack.push(40);

    HANDLE thread = CreateThread(
        NULL,         // lpThreadAttributes
        0,            // dwStackSize
        &thread_proc, // lpStartAddress
        &stack,       // lpParameter
        0,            // dwCreationFlags
        NULL          // lpThreadId
    );

    stack.pop(true);

    WaitForSingleObject(thread, INFINITE);
    CloseHandle(thread);

    stack.print();
    stack.assert_valid();  // randomly crash

    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, 2 threads are scheduled to run concurrently. To promote the occurrence of the ABA problem, the main thread calls `stack.pop(true)` with `Sleep(200)` to suspend the execution of the current thread, allowing other threads to run during this interruption. Before interleaving the main thread, the local pointer variable `head_ptr` points to `40` and `next_ptr` points to 30. Then, the second thread is likely to run during the suspension of the main one. We can assume that while the main thread is sleeping, the second one completes its operations (2 `pop`s and 1 `push`), transforms the stack into `[10, 20, 40]` and deallocates the memory of the node `30`. Afterwards, the main thread resumes its execution, where the method call `_head_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(head_ptr, next_ptr)` returns `true` (since the top of the stack is still `40`). It then sets `next_ptr` (which is a pointer to `30`) as the top of the stack. But since this memory is deallocated, it is unsafe to perform the assignment. Thus running the program above will randomly crash at the line `stack.assert_valid();`

It is worth noticing that since the memory pointed by `next_ptr` may not be touched anyway after deallocation, assigning `next_ptr` in the main thread still appears to work correctly (in this example, we have to clear a flag `valid` to mark the node as deallocated). Accessing freed memory is undefined behavior: this may result in crashes, data corruption or even just silently appear to work correctly.

### Real-world implications

### Addressing the ABA Problem

Several approaches can help mitigate the ABA problem:

* **Timestamps:** By associating a version number or timestamp with the data, threads can ensure the value hasn't changed between reads. An inconsistency arises if the version retrieved during the second read doesn't match the version associated with the initial value.
* **Locking mechanisms:** Utilizing synchronization primitives like mutexes or spinlocks ensures exclusive access to the shared memory location during critical sections. This prevents other threads from modifying the data while the first thread is performing its read-modify-write operation.
* **Atomic operations:** In specific scenarios, employing atomic operations that combine read and write into a single, indivisible step can eliminate the window of vulnerability between reads. However, atomic operations might not be suitable for all situations.

By understanding the ABA problem and implementing appropriate synchronization techniques, developers can ensure the integrity of data in multithreaded environments.
